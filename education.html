            <h2>Iowa State University</h2>
            <p>During August of 2018 I enrolled in Iowa State University to earn a bachelor's degree in software engineering.
            I graduated in May of 2022 with a 3.33 GPA. While at ISU, I was involved with university's IEEE-HKN branch, for which 
            I served as the Service Chair for two semesters and the Recording Secretary for one. I also participated in ISU's Web 
            Development club, where we would update websites per the request of the client, who was often another club at the school.
            Additionaly. I was involded in ISU's Data Science club.

            <h2>Des Moines Area Community College</h2>
            <p>I enrolled into DMACC in August of 2015, where I went for an Associate of Arts Degree and graduated in 2017 
                with a 3.76 GPA. While there I served on the Student Activities Council, where we worked to spend school funding 
                on student activities, such as such as when we had Chris Cakes come in and make pancakes for all the students. 
                I was also asked to be a chemistry tudor, but do to school funding I wasn't able to fulfil that.
